# Internal CRM vs Third‑Party CRM: Proposal

## Executive Summary

This document compares the option of continuing to build our **in‑house CRM** system against adopting a **third‑party CRM platform**.  It weighs the benefits, drawbacks, costs, and risks of each approach, and recommends the best path forward for Perceptive Controls.

## Why Build Our Own?

1. **Customisation and Control:**
   - We control the data model, user interface, and integrations.  The system can evolve precisely with our business processes rather than forcing us to adapt to a vendor’s workflow.
   - Security and compliance remain under our direct control; we decide where data lives and how it is backed up.

2. **Integration Flexibility:**
   - We can integrate seamlessly with our PLC programming tools, quoting systems, accounting software, and custom AI assistants.  Third‑party CRMs sometimes charge extra or have limited integration options.

3. **Cost Over Time:**
   - While the upfront engineering cost is higher, ongoing licence fees are eliminated.  For a team of ten users, a mid‑tier CRM subscription at \$50–\$100/user/month costs \$6 000–\$12 000 per year.  Over five years, this can exceed \$30 000, excluding add‑on modules.

4. **Innovation and Competitive Advantage:**
   - Owning the platform allows us to implement innovative features (e.g., automated quoting, AI‑powered diagnostics, summarisation).  A proprietary CRM may limit or delay new features.

## Why Choose a Third‑Party CRM?

1. **Rapid Deployment:**
   - Hosted CRMs (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho) can be configured in days.  Training materials and support staff are readily available.
   - Features such as sales pipelines, marketing automation, and analytics are mature and immediately usable.

2. **Lower Initial Cost:**
   - Vendors amortise development cost across thousands of customers; subscription fees cover hosting, updates, and support.  There is no need to hire developers or dedicate internal resources.

3. **Built‑In Reliability & Compliance:**
   - Leading CRMs offer 99.9% uptime SLAs, secure data centres, and compliance (HIPAA, SOC 2) certifications.

4. **Continuous Improvements:**
   - Feature updates and bug fixes occur automatically.  Integration marketplaces provide dozens of connectors (email, phone, marketing, analytics) out of the box.

## Downsides of Building In‑House

* **Upfront Investment:** Building even a modest CRM requires several weeks of engineering, UI/UX design, testing, and deployment.  Enhancements such as scheduling, reporting, or multi‑tenant support add complexity.
* **Ongoing Maintenance:**  Bug fixes, security patches, dependency updates, and infrastructure upkeep are our responsibility.  Without dedicated staff, technical debt can accumulate.
* **Limited Third‑Party Integrations:**  External services (SMS providers, marketing tools) must be integrated manually.  A vendor solution may provide them as plug‑and‑play modules.

## Downsides of a Third‑Party CRM

* **Lack of Deep Customisation:**  We may not have access to low‑level data structures.  Extending or modifying workflows often requires expensive add‑ons or vendor professional services.
* **Data Portability & Vendor Lock‑In:**  Migrating away from a platform can be time‑consuming.  Proprietary features may not export easily.
* **Recurring Costs:**  Monthly subscription fees scale with user seats and modules.  Prices can increase unexpectedly.
* **Privacy & Control:**  Sensitive customer data is hosted externally.  While reputable vendors encrypt data, full control is lost.

## Recommendation

Building our own CRM gives us full flexibility and a strategic asset tailored to our workflow.  However, if we need an immediate solution with minimal overhead, a third‑party CRM is compelling.  A hybrid approach is possible: start with a vendor platform to manage leads and opportunities while developing the in‑house system incrementally.  Once our internal CRM reaches parity, we can migrate.
